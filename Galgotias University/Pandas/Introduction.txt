******Pandas******
-------------------
Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. 
It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series.
This library is built on top of the NumPy library. Pandas is fast and it has high performance & productivity for users.

Advantages 
-----------
  (i)Fast and efficient for manipulating and analyzing data.
  (ii)Data from different file objects can be loaded.
  (iii)Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
  (iv)Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
  (v)Data set merging and joining.
  (vi)Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
  (vii)Provides time-series functionality.
  (viii)Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.

Pandas generally provide two data structures for manipulating data, They are: 
  1.  Series
  2.  DataFrame
  3.  panel

1. Series :- It is defined as one dimensional Array that is capable of storing various data types.
2.Data frame=It is two dimensional Size mutable, potentialy, hetrogeneous tebular data structures with labeled access(Rows and columns)
                          In other words Data is align in tebular fashion(Rows and columns)
                          A pandas data frame created by loading  the data set from existing (scv file,Excel file)

          pd.DataFrame()

          




import pandas as pd
l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
